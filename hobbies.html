        <h3>Play Instruments</h3>
        <p>I started playing piano at a young age. Although I quitted playing it after high school, I still play it from time to time nowadays.</p>
        <p>In high school, I joined my school's marching band. Not only did I learn to play trombone, but I also spent (probably) the best two years in my life there. </p>
